I am assuming that you have already did a git clone of the FlyWithLua repository before using this info.


I wish this could be easier but because Fmod is not public this is what we have to do to allow building of FlyWithLua NG+. This is the method I have used but if someone comes up with a better way I would be very interested.

Starting with FlyWithLua NG+ version 2.8.0 we now support Fmod but I can't put the needed files on GitHub so you will need to get them your self if you want to build FlyWithLua NG+ yourself.

First you will need to create a account at https://www.fmod.com to allow you to download.

Next download the version for your platform at https://www.fmod.com/download#fmodengine

X-Plane is using the 2.02 version so make sure that is highlighted.


On Linux when you click on the download button it should look like this fmodstudioapi20209linux.tar.gz

On Mac when you click on the download button it should look like this fmodstudioapi20209mac-installer.dmg

On Windows when you click on the Download button it sould look like this fmodstudioapi20209win-installer.exe


On Windows and the Mac they have a installer so install it wherever you would like. On Linux there is no installer just the files.


************************************************  Linux   ****************************************************************************

On Linux if you extract the fmodstudioapi20209linux.tar.gz you will get a folder fmodstudioapi20209linux looking in that folder we are interested in the api folder. Inside the api folder we are interested in the core and studio folders that have inc and lib folders needed to build.


Next We need to create a new folder in FlyWithLua/src called Fmod_api and in that create a inc and lib folder.

So we need to copy all the .h files from api/core/inc to FlyWithLua/src/Fmod_api/inc folder

Next we copy all the .h files from api/studio/inc to FlyWithLua/src/Fmod_api/inc folder

Next copy api/core/lib/x86_64/libfmod.so.13.9 to FlyWithLua/src/Fmod_api/lib then rename it to libfmod.so.13

Next copy api/studio/lib/x86_64/libfmodstudio.so.13.9 to FlyWithLua/src/Fmod_api/lib then rename it to libfmodstudio.so.13


******************************************************   Mac  *****************************************************************************

After installing Fmod you will get a folder called FMOD Programmers API looking in that folder we are interested in the api folder. Inside the api folder we are interested in the core and studio folders that have inc and lib folders needed to build.

Next copy api/studio/lib/libfmodstudio.dylib to FlyWithLua/src/Fmod_api/lib
