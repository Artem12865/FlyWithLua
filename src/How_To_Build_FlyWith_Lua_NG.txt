I have tried to move all the dependicies into the src folder but if I have missed any please contact me.

Moving to the folder you want to build FlyWithLua NG in use the following commands.

First use "Git Clone https://github.com/X-Friese/FlyWithLua.git"

Now "cd FlyWithLua/scr"

Next "mkdir build"

Next "cd build"

Next "cmake .."

Next "make"

If everything went well you should see a *.xpl for the platform you are on.

My goal after getting this working is to be able to import the CMakeLists.txt file into CodeBlocks so that can be used for the IDE.
