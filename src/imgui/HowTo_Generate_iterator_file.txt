I am trying to document what is needed to use a newer version of Imgui.

The first Imgui version supported was 1.61 with FlyWithLua 2.7.0

The second Imgui version supported was 1.70 with FlyWithLua 2.7.23

The third version supported Imgui 1.77 with FlyWithLua 2.7.27

This version supports Imgui 1.85 with FlyWithLua 2.7.34

Updated support for Imgui 1.85 with FlyWithLua 2.8.3

For some reason the current generate_imgui_bindings.pl file is missing a parameter for the scalars.

Because of that the imgui_iterator.inl needs to be hand edited to get it to build correctly.

Currently you have to make sure that flags are in this format flags = x in the imgui.h
I want to modify the pearl script so this is not needed but I lack the knowledge on Perl to make that kind of change.
 

Use this perl command to generate the imgui_iterator.inl file from the imgui.h file

perl generate_imgui_bindings.pl <imgui.h >imgui_iterator.inl


To make Perl verbose

First do sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install Devel::Trace'

perl -d:Trace generate_imgui_bindings.pl <imgui.h >imgui_iterator.inl
