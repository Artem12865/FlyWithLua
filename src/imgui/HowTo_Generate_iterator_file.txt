I am trying to document what is needed to use a newer version of Imgui.

The first Imgui version supported was 1.61 with FlyWithLua 2.7.0

The second Imgui version supported was 1.70 with FlyWithLua 2.7.23

The third version supported Imgui 1.77 with FlyWithLua 2.7.27

This version supports Imgui 1.85 with FlyWithLua 2.7.34

Currently you have to make sure that flags are in this format flags = x
I want to modify the pearl script so this is not needed but I lack the knowledge on Perl to make that kind of change.
 

Use this perl command to generate the imgui_iterator.inl file from the imgui.h file

perl generate_imgui_bindings.pl <imgui.h >imgui_iterator.inl

Results for Imgui 1.77 are:

Normal Imgui functions:   Supported: 249 Unsupported: 99
Imgui DrawList functions: Supported: 38 Unsupported: 14


Results for Imgui 1.85 are:

Normal Imgui functions:   Supported: 268 Unsupported: 104
Imgui DrawList functions: Supported: 43 Unsupported: 16


Using the current perl script there is no need for any manual additions to the generated imgui_iterator.inl file.
