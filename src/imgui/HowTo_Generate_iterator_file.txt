I am trying to document what is needed to use a newer version of Imgui.

The first Imgui version supported was 1.61 with FlyWithLua 2.7.0

The second Imgui version supported was 1.70 with FlyWithLua 2.7.23

This version supports Imgui 1.76 with FlyWithLua 2.7.27

Use this perl command to generate the imgui_iterator.inl file from the imgui.h file

perl generate_imgui_bindings.pl <imgui.h >imgui_iterator.inl

Results are:

Normal Imgui functions:   Supported: 245 Unsupported: 103
Imgui DrawList functions: Supported: 36 Unsupported: 14

Using the current perl script there is no need for any manual additions to the generated imgui_iterator.inl file.
