If you want to convert the binaries into the binaries used by the Complete Edition, you will have to replace the files lin.xpl, mac.xpl and win.xpl inside the folder "64".

This will *not* convert your installation into a Complete Edition, but it will kill all restrictions of the Core Edition.

To have the Complete Edition, you will have to download it from the internet. If you only replace the binaries, you will miss the additional libraries included into the Complete Edition.

If you grab a script that is remarked as "Complete Edition of FlyWithLua version xyz required", it might be necassary to have all additional libraries installed.

And always remember, loosing the restrictions meens loosing all support. This is for your own risk (and fun?).

Happy landings!
